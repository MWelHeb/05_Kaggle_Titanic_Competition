Next data science area which I was interested in related to the topic of finance. When it comes to investing money many advices center around investments into ETF (i.e. exchange traded funds vs. e.g. single stocks). Therefore I wanted to get a better understanding on the variety of ETFs and their historical developments. How did the prices of different ETF develop in recent years? Which ETF had a large (annual) return over a given time period? How volatile were these returns? What is the ratio between return and volatility for a given ETF. Is there a strong positive/negative correlation amongst the returns of different ETF?
